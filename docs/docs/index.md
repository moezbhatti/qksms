!!! Note "Disclaimer:"
    The current condition of the QKSms v2.x codebase is quite poor
    *(I guess that's what happens when you start writing an app when you don't even know how to code yet)*.
    I'm in the process of rebuilding the app from scratch using Kotlin - pull requests will not be accepted
    during this time.
    Feel free to follow the progress here - https://github.com/moezbhatti/qksms/tree/qksms3

Special shoutout to Jake Klinker ([@klinker41](https://github.com/klinker41)) for his work on [android-smsmms](https://github.com/klinker41/android-smsmms), which has been an unspeakably large help in implementing MMS in QKSMS.
